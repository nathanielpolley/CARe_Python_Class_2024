# First I created my dictionary, afterwards I established my loop by establishing total samples 0 to sum up the microbial species.
#Then I added new species with their count to the dictionary
#Then I added a while loop to get user input
#While loop asks the user for a new species name, if they enter quit then it breaks, and if the species is already present then it continues. The inner while loop ensures that the entered number is a positive integer; if it is not, it would break, and except Value error 
would ask for a valid integer number. This 'microbial_species[new_species] = sample_count' adds the user input to the dictionary.
