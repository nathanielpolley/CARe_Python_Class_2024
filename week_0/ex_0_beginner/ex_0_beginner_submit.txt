The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

Hola soy Dora!! Nah not really because I have everything she has per se except for a monkey. My name is Rajath and I'm an explorer. I mostly love exploring in the ocean of knowledge. I come from the land that is after the Indus river which is profoundly known as India. Having done a Bachelor of Engineering in Biotechnology, I have landed in Toulouse for my Master's. With an interest in biology and looking at how the world is moving towards technology, I am slowly moving towards programming. I have a teensie bit of programming knowledge which I am not really confident of and that brings me here. Too long introduction. See ya soon!

I'd say never. Humans are no less a computer in my opinion.
