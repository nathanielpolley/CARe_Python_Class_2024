I come from the land that is after the Indus river which is profoundly known as India. Having done a Bachelor of Engineering in Biotechnology, I have landed in Toulouse for my Master's. With an interest in biology and looking at how the world is moving towards technology, I am slowly moving towards programming. I have a teensie bit of programming knowledge which I am not really confident of and that brings me here. Too long introduction. See ya soon!")
