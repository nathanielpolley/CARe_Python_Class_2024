Intermediate Homework Assignments (1.5 points):

1. Microbial Growth Rate Calculator (Variables and Input/Output):

- Write a Python program that calculates the growth rate of a microbial culture based on user input for initial
    and final cell counts and the time elapsed.
- Prompt the user to input the initial count, final count, and time.
- Calculate and display the growth rate using the formula: Growth Rate = (ln(final count) - ln(initial count)) / time.
- Ensure that the program handles invalid input gracefully.

# Input from the user
import math

time = int(input("Enter time in hours: "))

# Conditional statements
if time < 0:
    print("invalid time")
else:
    initial_count = int(input("Enter initial count: "))

# Conditional statements
if initial_count < 1:
    print("invalid initial count")

# Again for final count
final_count = int(input("Enter final count: "))

if initial_count<1 or final_count < initial_count:
    print("invalid final count")

else:
    calculus=(math.log(final_count) - math.log(initial_count)) / time
    print(f"Growth rate is: {calculus}")
